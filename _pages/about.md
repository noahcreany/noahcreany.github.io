# About Me
Hi There - Iâ€™m Noah, 

I am a post-doctoral researcher with the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) working with the United States Forest Service (USFS) Pacific Northwest Research Station and currently located in Fort Collins, Colorado. 

I recently completed my PhD in Ecology studying under Dr. Christopher A. Monz at Utah State University. Specifically, my disciplinary focus is Recreation Ecology, which aims to understand the social and ecological dimensions of recreation management in park and protected area settings to inform sustainable management strategies. The overarching goal of this research is to maintain opportunities and the associated social benefits of wildland/outdoor recreation in balance with the habitat and conservation goals of those settings.
